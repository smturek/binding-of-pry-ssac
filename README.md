# The Binding of Pryssac
A close approximation to a twin stick shooter, except instead of using a controller you use your keyboard.

Survive for as long as you can clearing levels of enemies. The enemies increase in number and complexity as you progress.

Think Binding of Issac, but everything is just multi-colored blocks



### Key Features
* Procedurally generated levels. No two play-throughs are identical
* Enemies sometimes drop powerups
* Bullet objects are managed in pools and reused so that the game won't slow down over time
